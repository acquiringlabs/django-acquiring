# django-acquiring is now acquiring[django]

Back in the day, I gave a talk called [Pyments: How to Design Payment Applications in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o4RgvXcYVw). You're probably here because of that talk.

Good news is...I've renamed the project. It now supports other frameworks beyond Django, so it was only reasonable to change its name too.

Go check it out [here](https://github.com/acquiringlabs/acquiring)!
